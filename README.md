- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @bt-thomass
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in becoming a Marketing Analyst or Data Analyst in some sort of way, I enjoy working out looking at data and finding the
    stories and patterns that are in the data in order to create better models for prediction, helping resourceful people make better decisions
    and in the end learn more about the data itself!
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning in Seattle University with a double degree in Data Analytics and Business Marketing, I will be graduating 2022 Spring!
